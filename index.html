      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/ross.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Ross Reeves">

      <p>
          I began delivering technology solutions for customers in 1970. 
          While technology has continued to evolve and occasionally undergoes radical change, 
          customer expectations remain consistent. "Implement effective technical solutions 
          without negatively impacting business."
      </p>
      <p>
          Since the financial crisis of 2008, the IPO market in the U.S. has been 
          volatile. Since the dot-com bubble in 2000, the annual number of IPOs has fallen to 
          less than one third the average in the 1990s, and smaller IPOs have almost disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
          Technology evolved from a highly centralized, controlled, and capital intensive 
          environment to a decentralized, unstable, and labor intensive environment, and more 
          recently back to a centralized, virtual, services environment.
      </p>
      <p>
          Much of the software required to operate businesses is dated, and impossible 
          to maintain cost effectively. Migration to open software environments has increased 
          vulnerabilities to hacking, complexity, and instability.
      </p>
      <p>
          This evolution creates an opportunity for entrepreneurship that hasn't been available for 
          20 years. Smaller start-ups can take advantage of both the services and scale available 
          from centralized, virtual environments and avoid large capital investments. There is 
          abundant private equity available. This describes the opportunity that most interests me.
